## Models and Nodes Setup

### Models

- [Juggernaut Reborn SD1.5](https://civitai.com/models/46422/juggernaut)
- [IC-Light](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ic-light)

### Nodes

- **ComfyUI Manager**: A tool for managing nodes and models within ComfyUI. [ComfyUI Manager GitHub repository](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager)

> **👉🏻 You can install all missing nodes in a workflow, or install custom nodes with ease from the Manager Menu. Restart your ComfyUI after installation.**

Of course, you can install nodes manually with `git`, but the Manager is a great tool to have.

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Load Initial Image and Resize

Start by loading the image you want to relight. This could be any object you want to enhance with IC-Light. Ensure the image is resized appropriately to match the required input dimensions.

![Step 1](/articles/article-4/step1.png)

### 2. Apply BRIAAI Matting (or any background removal node)

Use the BRIAAI Matting node to separate the object from the background. This step ensures that the object is correctly isolated for precise relighting.

### 3. Light Source Configuration

Configure the light source parameters using the LightSource node. Adjust the direction, intensity, and color of the light to achieve the desired effect.

![Step 3](/articles/article-4/step3.png)

### 4. Encode with VAE

Encode the image using VAE to prepare it for IC-Light conditioning. This step ensures that the image data is in the correct format for subsequent processing.

![Step 4](/articles/article-4/step4.png)

### 5. Use CLIP Text Encoding for Guidance

Utilize the CLIPTextEncode nodes to provide positive and negative textual guidance. This step helps in fine-tuning the lighting effect by providing contextual information.

### 6. Load and Apply SD1.5 and IC-Light Conditioning

Load and apply the SD1.5 checkpoint, as well as the IC-Light model using the LoadAndApplyICLightUnet node. This node integrates the IC-Light model into your workflow, allowing you to apply sophisticated lighting effects to your image.

### 7. Image Synthesis with KSampler

The KSampler node is used to synthesize the final image. It takes all conditioned inputs and model outputs to generate the new image with the desired lighting effects.

### 8. Final Decoding and Preview

Finally, decode the latent image back to the visual format using the VAEDecode node. Preview the results to ensure the outcome meets your expectations.
